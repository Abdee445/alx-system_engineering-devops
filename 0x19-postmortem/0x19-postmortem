Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: February 17, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC-5)
End Time: February 17, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC-5)
Impact:
The outage affected our primary web application, rendering it completely inaccessible to users.
Approximately 80% of our users experienced service disruption during this time, resulting in frustration and potential loss of business.
Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on one of the backend servers.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
10:05 AM: Engineering team notified automatically via alert system.
10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on backend server logs and database performance metrics.
10:30 AM: Assumed root cause to be a database bottleneck due to increased traffic.
10:45 AM: Database team escalated the issue to network infrastructure team for further investigation.
11:00 AM: Network team identified misconfigured load balancer settings causing uneven distribution of traffic.
11:30 AM: Load balancer settings adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across backend servers.
12:00 PM: Service fully restored as traffic balanced properly.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer resulted in one backend server receiving significantly more traffic than others, causing it to become overwhelmed and unresponsive.
Resolution Details:
Adjustments were made to the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across all backend servers, alleviating the overload on any single server.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement regular audits of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular insights into server traffic distribution.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify any other potential misconfigurations.
Implement automated alerts for load balancer performance metrics to detect anomalies in traffic distribution.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to stay updated on best practices for load balancer management.
Document the incident and share lessons learned with relevant teams to improve incident response and resolution times in the future.
By implementing these corrective measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages occurring in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable web application for our users.
